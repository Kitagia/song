A little late for all the things you didn't say
I'm not sad for you
But I'm sad for all the time I had to waste
'Cause I learned the truth

Your heart is in a place I no longer want to be
I knew there'd come a day
I'd set you free
'Cause I'm sick and tired
Of always being sick and tired

Your love isn't fair
You live in a world where you didn't listen
And you didn't care
So I'm floating
Floating on air

Oh, yeah
No warning of such a sad song
Of broken hearts
My dreams of fairy tales and fantasy, oh
Were torn apart
